# Starting with R

## Task Overview

Blackwell believes that the best way to learn is through trial and error, so after your tutorial, you’ll be asked to test your knowledge through running a script of code. The dataset that you’ll be using through this analysis is the iris.csv file, which is also in the zip file attached to Danielle’s email. Don’t be too surprised if you encounter errors or warning messages. Take a few deep breaths and embrace the errors!
